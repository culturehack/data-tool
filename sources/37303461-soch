Swedish Open Cultural Heritage (SOCH) is a metadata aggregator and web service for cultural heritage institutions in Sweden, and contains monuments, buildings, museum collections etc from the Paleolithic to the present day.

SOCH contains over 6.3 million database objects from around 50 heritage institutions (as of May 2016). Only metadata is indexed – all objects link back to a permanent URI at the source institution with their full record.
